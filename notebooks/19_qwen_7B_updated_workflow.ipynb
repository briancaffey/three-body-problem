      "随着三体运动的发展，三体叛军中出现了第三个派别：幸存派。当人侵太阳系的外星舰队的存在被确切证实后，在那场终极战争中幸存下来是人们最自然的愿望。当然，战争是四百五十年之后的事了，与自己的此生无关，但很多人希望如果人类战败，自己在四个半世纪后的子孙能幸存下来。现在就为三体侵略者服务，显然有利于这个目标的实现。与另外两个主流派别比较，幸存派成员都来自较低的社会阶层，且东方人（特别是中国人）居多，他们目前的数量还很少，但人数在急剧增长，在三体文化日益普及的未来，将会成为一支不可忽视的力量。\n",

      "With the development of the Three-body Movement, a third faction has emerged in the Three-body rebels: The survivalists. When the existence of an extraterrestrial fleet invading the solar system was confirmed, it became the most natural wish for people to survive the ultimate war. Of course, this is hundreds of years after the war, and has nothing to do with their own lives, but many people hope that if human beings lose, their descendants four and a half centuries later can survive. Now serving the Three-body invaders is clearly conducive to achieving this goal. Compared to the two mainstream factions, members of the survivalist faction come from lower social classes and are predominantly Easterners (especially Chinese), with a small number currently, but rapidly growing numbers, and in the future when the Three-body culture becomes more popular, they will become an unstoppable force.\n",

One-tenth the speed of light is the fastest it can reach, and it can only cruise for a very short time at this speed before beginning to decelerate. Additionally, the propulsion power of the three-body spacecraft is annihilation of matter and antimatter. There is a huge magnetic field in front of the spacecraft, forming a funnel-shaped magnetic shield, which collects antimatter particles from space. This collection process is very slow, and after a long time, it can obtain enough antimatter particles for the spacecraft to accelerate for a certain period. Therefore, the acceleration of the three-body fleet takes place in an intermittent manner, and it takes much longer to collect sufficient antimatter particles than it does for small probes to reach the solar system.

The use of basic particles at the front line, from our hairy ancestors lighting fires in caves, has been going on since then, with control over chemical reactions occurring at a one-dimensional level. Of course, this control also progresses from low to high, from fires to later steam engines, to later generators; now, human control of subatomic dimensions at a one-dimensional level has reached its peak, with computers and your nanomaterials. But all of this is limited to one-dimensional control of subatomic dimensions, which from the perspective of a more advanced civilization in the universe, are no different from fires and computers, nanomaterials, etc., belonging to the same level. This is why they still consider us to be bugs - unfortunately, they are right.\"\n",

The uppermost slices moved forward at the fastest speed and gradually receded from the lower ones, like a deck of cards being pushed forward one by one; this giant ship was like a pile of cards being pushed forward by someone. These large pieces of wood slipped over each other while sliding, making a shrill sound like countless fingers scraping glass.

As they got closer, those薄片 that were closest to the front went further and further away, like a stack of plates from a waiter who fell over in front of you.

I ate everything that could be eaten in the station, even my own clothes. Even so, when the supply car returned, I was on the verge of starvation. Therefore, my superiors granted me the longest vacation of my life. On the way back to the city with the supply car, I was always under the control of a strong desire - to possess all the food on the car. Every time I saw others eat, my heart filled with hatred and really wanted to kill him. I kept stealing food from the car, hiding it in my clothes and under the seats. The staff on the car thought it was interesting that I did this, so they presented the food as gifts to me.

For this, I consulted an admirable scholar who was good at building teaching models and was not a science fiction fan, but he was also an enthusiast. He corrected my wrong model for me.
